# Seefood (CS190i, UCSB, Spring 2017)

Inspired by Jian-Yangâ€™s revolutionary Not Hotdog app, a group of four of us hopped on the food identification hype. The end result? An android app, aptly named SeeFood, capable of identifying any food you threw at it. The account system which allows users to access their valuable identified food on any device is powered by Firebase and the state of the art image recognition is a sophisticated proprietary algorithm (the clarifai api).
